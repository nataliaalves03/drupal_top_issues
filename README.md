# The task
Create a Drupal module which can be used to display most active issues for a project maintained at Drupal.org.

# Steps to reproduce:

This project was set-up in a pre-installed XAMPP with PHP Version 7.3.21 and MariaDB.

Run: composer -n create-project drupal/recommended-project:^8.9 drupal_top_issues

Copy /custom folder to /modules folder to the new Drupal project. Attention: do not copy to inside of /core/modules folder.

# Final result

There are 4 images illustrating the final result, the custome module installations, adding the block to sidebar, configuring the block and displaing the list of project issues in sidebar.
